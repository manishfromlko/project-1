# Tasks: Webapp Frontend

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-webapp-frontend/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL - not requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app**: `webapp/` directory at repository root
- Paths shown assume webapp/ structure from plan.md

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create webapp/ directory structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize Next.js 14 project with TypeScript and App Router
- [ ] T003 Configure Tailwind CSS with custom configuration
- [ ] T004 Install and configure shadcn/ui components

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T009 Create app/ directory structure with layout.tsx and page.tsx
- [ ] T010 [P] Set up components/ directory with ui/ subdirectory
- [ ] T011 [P] Create lib/ directory for utilities and API client
- [ ] T012 [P] Set up types/ directory for TypeScript definitions from data-model.md
- [ ] T013 [P] Create hooks/ directory for custom React hooks
- [ ] T014 Configure public/ directory for static assets
- [ ] T015 Create environment configuration with .env.local template
- [ ] T016 Install React Query (TanStack Query) for state management
- [ ] T017 [P] Create API client configuration for workspaces and search APIs
- [ ] T018 [P] Set up error handling utilities and global error boundaries
- [ ] T019 Configure build and development scripts in package.json

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Dashboard Overview (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: As a user, I want to view a dashboard overview of all workspaces so that I can get a quick understanding of the system status.

**Independent Test**: Navigate to the dashboard page and verify that workspace cards are displayed with key metrics, and the interface is responsive.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US3 for workspace context

### Within Each User Story

- Types and API hooks before components
- Components before pages
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Types and API hooks within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Components within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Terminal 1: Types and API
npm run dev  # Start dev server
# Implement T020, T021 in parallel

# Terminal 2: Components  
# Implement T022, T023, T024, T025, T026 in parallel

# Terminal 3: Page integration
# Implement T027, T028, T029 after components ready
```
